3 D Model of Gun

 In making of this Gun , I have used various tools such as face, vertex, edge tool, insert egde tool and lambert to insert image .
 Lambert is also used to change colour and transparency of object.
 In making it we requires only basic polygon and that is CUBE and then various cubes will be modified using above tools.
 One needs to learn some of basic key shortcuts like " 3 for smooth "," 1 for hard" etc.
